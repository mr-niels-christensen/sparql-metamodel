sparql-metamodel
==============================

Experimental illustration of alternatives in accessing RDF data through Apache MetaModel. This is a TOY implementation to be used in a small blog post. A serious implementation would subclass QueryPostprocessDataContext and use the many SQL-like features of SPARQL.

This project requires Java 1.7+ and Gradle. When Java and Gradle are installed, you may type
```
gradle run
```
compile and run the example.
